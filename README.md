## MLops
This repository presents a simple project built on some of the tools from the MLOps stack - this is an example PyTorch model for image classification, for which an API was created. \
The project mainly uses PyTorch-Lightning, FastAPI, pytest, DVC, Docker, Github Actions.

This project is just an example of a combination of several tools. 
For more functionality, DVC should be connected to a remote repository.
